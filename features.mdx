Organize your documentation into nested structures resembling folders and subfolders. This creates a clear navigation tree that scales with your projects.

|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Tags | Narrow by predefined labels | `api`, `setup` |
| Date Range | Find recent updates | Last 30 days |
| Author | Content by specific users | `@john.doe` |
| Full-Text | Keyword matching | "authentication" |
